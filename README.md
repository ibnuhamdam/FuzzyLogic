# FuzzyLogic
This is one of the fuzzy logic algorithms in python. In this fuzzy algorithm I use the Sugeno method. The function of this program is to determine 20 BLT recipients based on data containing 100 people with income and debt that has been determined. With Fuzzy Logic we can determine 20 people who deserve BLT assistance.
